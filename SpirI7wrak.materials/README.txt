This file describes supplemental materials distributed with
the interactive fiction work "SpirI7wrak" which are not
available by default in the Inform 7 6G60 release.

This file is intended to be usable with a very basic text
editor that displays text in a fixed-width spacing, such as
Microsoft's Notepad utility. Users of editors which display
text using variable-width spacing (i.e. Microsoft's Wordpad
utility, or word processors in general) may wish to convert
the text in this file to a fixed-width font such as Courier
to improve readability.


  * README.txt - this file, a short guide to included
                 supplemental materials

  * play-if-card.pdf - a copy of the very helpful and
                       concise beginner's guide to IF
                       (interactive fiction), which may be
                       useful to you if you are not
                       familiar with IF in general or
                       "old school"-style games in
                       particular

  * spiritwrak_r3_I5.5_src.zip - a ZIP archive file of
                                 the original Inform 5.5
                                 source code for Daniel S.
                                 Yu's "Spiritwrak"; for
                                 reference and comparison

  * COPYING - the "official" version of the COPYING file
              required for distribution with all works
              using the GPL v3, such as this one; this
              file lacks a file extension to identify it
              as a text file to Windows environments, and
              it uses Unix-style carriage return/line feed
              encoding, so it may not display well in a
              Windows environment

  * COPYING.txt - a version of the COPYING file above that
                  has a file extension and carriage return/
                  line feed encoding to make it Windows-
                  friendly
